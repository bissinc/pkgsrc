# OpenBSD IMSG
The **imsg** functions provide a simple mechanism for communication
between local processes using sockets. Each transmitted message is
guaranteed to be presented to the receiving program whole.<br>
They are commonly used in privilege separated processes, where
processes with different rights are required to cooperate.
